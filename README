==jquery-timeslider==

Simple unobtrusive timeslider that pops up under the specified field.


=Usage=
$('#inputfield').timeslider()

=Options=
An optional options hash can be passed in. Currently does not let you do much, but you can change the default number of minutes per slider step with options.minutes (note works best when it is a number that divides 60 i.e. n in [1,2,4,5,6,10,15,20,30])

=Requirements=
timeslider() uses the jquery-ui slider element so it needs some reasonable versions both jquery and jquery-ui. Not sure what how early it will stop working, but my implementation is fairly basic - it might go quite far down.
timeslider() is also implemented using jquery-hotkeys @ https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys but i am sure it coult be implemented without this as well. At any rate, this secondary dependency is only 3kb unminified, and it's very useful.
